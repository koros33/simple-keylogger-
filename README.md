# Ethical Keylogger 

**Purpose:** A small, safe, educational demo showing how keyboard event listeners work in Python using `pynput`. This repository is designed for classroom use only and is intentionally non-malicious: it prints captured keys to the console and does not save or transmit them.

> **Safety & consent:** Do not run this on other people's machines. Run only in a controlled environment (VM or lab machine). Obtain explicit consent from participants. Do NOT type real passwords or private information during the demo.

## Contributing

This project is open for contributions that improve documentation, safety checks, or add defensive/detection demonstrations. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for rules.

* Defensive/detection content (e.g., how to detect keyloggers) is encouraged.
* Add tests or a well-documented manual testing plan when adding features.
* Include clear instructions and safety guidance in any PR touching code.

## How to open a PR

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Run tests / linting if applicable.
