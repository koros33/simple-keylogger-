# Ethical Keylogger 

**Purpose:** A small, safe, educational demo showing how keyboard event listeners work in Python using `pynput`. This repository is designed for classroom use only and is intentionally non-malicious: it prints captured keys to the console and does not save or transmit them.

> **Safety & consent:** Do not run this on other people's machines. Run only in a controlled environment (VM or lab machine). Obtain explicit consent from participants. Do NOT type real passwords or private information during the demo.
